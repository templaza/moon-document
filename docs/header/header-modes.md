2. Select a **Header Mode** option.
3. Save your changes.

The horizontal header layout arranges elements in a row across the page. It offers three different menu placement options: left, center, and right.

* **Left**: The logo and the menu items are positioned to the left and the header block is to the right
* **Center**: Here the logo is to the left, menu items are in the center and the header block is on the right
* **Right**: Here the logo is to the left, the menu items and header block are to the right

## Stacked Header

The stacked header provides more complex layouts with elements stacked in multiple rows. It supports five layout variants:

* **Center Balance** - Logo centered between left and right sections
* **Center** - Logo and menu centered
* **Separated** - Logo with menu items separated evenly
* **Divided** - Logo on left, menu below
* **Divided** Logo Left - Logo on left in a fixed width column with menu and other elements in adjacent columns

## Sidebar Header

The sidebar header positions elements in a vertical column on the side of the page. It offers three placement options:

* **Left** - Vertical header on the left side
* **Right** - Vertical header on the right side
* **Topbar** - Combination of horizontal topbar with vertical sidebar

## Header Blocks 
Choose what you want to display in the header blocks from the given options in the dropdown that is:

* **Blank**: Leave a blank space
* **Region**: Publish a module whose position you can choose in the next option Block Position

### Header Breakpoint

Choose a breakpoint so the header will collapse when the width is less than the selected breakpoint parameter. The lg is set as default breakpoint to suit most of the cases.
