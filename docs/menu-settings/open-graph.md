# Open Graph
Moon Framework allows you to add Open Graph meta tags to your Joomla template. Open Graph tags are used to control how your content appears when shared on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

## ❓ What is Open Graph?

When you share a **link** on platforms like Facebook, Zalo, LinkedIn, etc., it usually shows:

- A preview image
- A title
- A short description

👉 The **Open Graph** feature lets **you control** what shows up when people share your website.

## 🔧 How to Enable Open Graph

### 🪜 Steps:

1. **Log in** to your Joomla Administrator.
2. Go to **Menus > [Select your menu]**.
3. Click on a **Menu Item** (the page you want to edit).
4. Go to the **Open Graph** tab.
