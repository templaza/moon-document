# Preset Profiles

The Preset Profiles module allows administrators to quickly configure and manage theme settings by applying predefined configuration profiles. Presets help ensure consistency, reduce setup time, and simplify theme customization across the system.

## Loading Presets

To load a preset of a prebuilt style, please click on the Load Preset button to proceed. It will ask you "Your current configure will be lost and overwritten by new data. Are you sure?" Agree Ok and the process will be done > then save.

## How To Export

You can easily export all your Moon settings by hovering on each preset, and clicking on the Download icon. 
The preset (JSON file) downloaded and saved on your computer can be imported later to restore your template settings.

## How To Import

Importing is as easy as exporting, just click Save/Import > Import option and select the JSON file from your computer.

Choose the JSON file you want to import and click Open and Submit. Then the preset file will be successfully imported.
