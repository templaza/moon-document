4. Click the “Template Options” button.
5. Go to the `Offline Page` tab.
6. Here, you can customize the offline page settings:
   - **Coming Soon Image**: Upload an image to be displayed on the offline page. This can be a logo or any other relevant image.
   - **Countdown Date**: Set a date for the countdown timer. This is useful if you want to indicate when the site will be back online.
   - **Countdown Finish Text**: Enter the text to display when the countdown reaches zero. This can be a message like "We are back!" or "Stay tuned!".
   - **Social Icons**: Add links to your social media profiles. This allows visitors to follow you on social platforms while your site is offline.
   - **Background Type**: Choose the background type for the offline page. You can select from options like `Image`, `Color`, or `Video`.
