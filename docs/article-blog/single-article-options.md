## Key Features

* **Author Info**: The Author information is displayed underneath the article, the author information is updated in the Author profile in User Tab.
* **Article Rating**: Article rating/review shows the star rating for a single article and allows a user to give a star rating. This enhances Joomla’s core voting functionality feature which displays a drop-down menu to rate the article, instead, it modifies it by allowing the star functionality and also displays the number of votes received.
* **Related Articles**: Allows you to display a list of related posts underneath the article post. The list is based on the meta keyword of the post which makes them more relevant and more likely to display. The settings also allow displaying the number of related article you want to display.
* **Social Buttons Type**: You can also enable Social Share buttons under each article. You can use the default style or ShareThis content-sharing platform to add social buttons.
  * **Default**: The default social button offers you some social channels including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Pinterest.
